"""
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
